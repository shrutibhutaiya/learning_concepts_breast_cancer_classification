Step 1 :
Download Data from UCL Repository and understand it.
It is about cell details - we have to predict whether the cell is of cancer or non cancer.

Step 2 :
Train and Test Subsets

Step 3 :
Use SVM Model/Algorithm for classication

Step 4 :
Check Accuracy

Step 5 :
Accuracy not so well ? Improve it. 
Via Two technique - 
  -- Noramlization of all the attribute values
  -- Using GridSearch
